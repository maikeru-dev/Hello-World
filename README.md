# Hello-World
This is a test Minecraft plugin I originally started on local, but decided to push to remote on GitHub.
This project was obviously coded with Java, because my University uses that mostly, and it seems to have worked well using the Paper Plugin API.
It is a slight passion project, despite being called Hello-World, as it provides several standard server features.
If the code is bad... excuse is that I learned how oop works only in January '23 -> March '23.

# What works at the moment?
- [x] Hologram basic functionality (Spawn floating text, kill floating text)
- [] Advanced Hologram functionality (Edit text -> add text, remove text)
- [] Extra Hologram functionality (Parse color and text information to pass to kyori's TextComponent)
- [x] PM and Reply Command (Can send PM and reply to last PM messaged)
- [x] A flat file accessor class, works very well for accessing data inexcessively.
- [x]
